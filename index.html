				<p class="line-spacing">My name is Lance Schmittling and this is the online visual archive of my work. I consider myself fortunate, because my job entails doing what I love. I call myself a designer as it's a nice label for the print design / web design / illustration / motion design / branding work that I do.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="line-spacing">I have an extensive background with design. Starting at a young age, I collected action figures, comic books (X-Men & Spider-Man), and woke up early every Saturday for cartoons. My design education taught me how to effectively communicate through visual imagery. As a scholar of design, I am always teaching myself new things and firmly believe that practice makes perfect.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="line-spacing">My work has always been structured around challenging goals. I prioritize tasks, work hard and practice effective time-management strategies. I am motivated by the need to navigate multiple projects in a fast-paced and demanding environment â€“ which is accomplished by efficient and thoughtful organization.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="line-spacing">I have always been interested in learning web development, and recently took the necessary steps to begin this journey. I want to be a well-rounded designer, and this is a big step to becoming just that.</p>
